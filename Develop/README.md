# eCommerce Backend

## Description
- This is a Express.js API that simulates the back-end workings of an e-commerce website. It allows users to interact with the MySQL database using sequelize.


## Background
- I built this project to gain an understanding of the fundamental architecture that sites like Shopify and WooCommerce run off of.  It helped me solidify my understanding of Express API's, Sequelize, Relational Databases (MySQL), and Object Relational Mapping.


## Installation
- Make sure to run an 'npm i' command to ensure you have all dependencies installed.
- You can launch the app using "node server.js" in your terminal after navigating to the project folder. 


## Contributing
- Feel free to contribute to this project, but make sure to fork first.  Reach out to me at my email below with any questions.
